ROVO
====

i've forgotten what i wanted with the name, to be completely honest.
but this is a small ~~moon~~script which builds my shell's prompt

```
~/src/gwu_rovo/ >               < 76
[sdc1] anime/a-1_pictures/ >       <
/etc/acpi/actions >                <
```

it's nothing **special** but it gets the job done and it's less buggy than my
bash implementation :P
